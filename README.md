## Scope, hoisting and compartmentalization

### Answer the following:
In your own words, explain the concepts of scope, hoisting, compartmentalization.

Scope refers to two different labels, which are local and global. Global scope is more accessible and if you are not careful, can be edited without your permission, whereas local scope hides your code from the internet. Depending on the scope of your code, certain variables and functions will be inaccessible.  Accessibility and security are key in being a great developer.

Hoisting is the process and order that JS runs your variables and function declarations and moves them to the top. You can use this to your advantage by running functions that you have not declared variables for yet.  This can cause bugs and the results can vary greatly.  It is best practice to declare variables in the top of your code.

Compartmentalization is using scope to not pollute the global scope with yours.  By using localized scope, you can create variable and function names, without compromising the window object.
